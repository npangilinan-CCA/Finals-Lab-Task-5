# [Finals Lab Task 5 - Using SQL views and Stored Procedures and Stored Functions](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20163366/pangilinan_FinalsLabTask5.docx)
In this portfolio, I showcase how I used SQL views, stored procedures, and functions to handle and work with database data. I included examples like using views to filter information, stored procedures to update records, and functions to pull specific data.

## Step by Step Process

### Step 1
- Create a VIEW that will display the vendors_code, vendors name, product description p_indate, of all products with p_indate from 2002 onwards

### Step 2
- Create a VIEW that will display all products whose price range is between 100-150

### Step 3
- Create a VIEW that will COMPUTE for the (TOTAL_PRICE) of ALL PRODUCTS by getting the (P_ONHAND x P_PRICE) Sold by vendors with the following v_code (21344, 23119 and 24288)

### Step 4
- Create a STORED PROCEDURE that WILL take a SINGLE PARAMETER and UPDATED the Name of Vendor ‘Bryson,Inc.’ to ‘Bryson and Co’.

### Step 5
- Create a Function that will take 2 parameters(v_code and v_state) and display All the product description and price based on the parameters passed to the function
